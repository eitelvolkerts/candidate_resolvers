# On submission of resolvers
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a subfolder, preferably named after your TG identifier
3. Upload your resolver and job contracts. If they are in the same contract, upload that contract only. If you desire to submit multiple job-resolver pairs, ensure the naming is unambiguous.
4. It is desirable to upload Foundry tests so that we (and you!) can ensure your contracts are written correctly in a simpler fashion.
5. Create a pull request. If I am sluggish to review it, tag me in the testnet chat (@euler2718)
6. Enjoy!
